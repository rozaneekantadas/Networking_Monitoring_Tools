This guide will assume you have a working Ubuntu Server already installed with SSH enabled and ready to go. If you need help with installing Ubuntu server, refer here

If youâ€™re more visual and prefer to watch an installation walk through, refer here

Aside from that, lets jump straight into installing Zabbix 6.4 PRE-RELEASE on top of Ubuntu Server 22.04.1 which as  the time of this writing, is latest and greatest versions of both ->

1. Install ubuntu server 22.04.1 and enable ssh

2. SSH to your Ubuntu server to run install commands

3. Install and configure Zabbix for your platform

Run the following cmds:

sudo -s

wget https://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/7.0/ubuntu/pool/main/z/zabbix-release/zabbix-release_latest+ubuntu24.04_all.deb

dpkg -i zabbix-release_latest+ubuntu24.04_all.deb

apt update

apt install zabbix-server-mysql zabbix-frontend-php zabbix-apache-conf zabbix-sql-scripts zabbix-agent

4. Install sql server

apt-get install mysql-server

systemctl start mysql

5. Create initial database

mysql

create database zabbix character set utf8mb4 collate utf8mb4_bin;

create user zabbix@localhost identified by 'password';

grant all privileges on zabbix.* to zabbix@localhost;

set global log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1;

quit;

6. On Zabbix server host import initial schema and data. You will be prompted to enter your newly created password.

sudo zcat /usr/share/zabbix-sql-scripts/mysql/server.sql.gz | mysql --default-character-set=utf8mb4 -uzabbix -p zabbix

7. Disable log_bin_trust_function_creators option after importing database schema.

sudo mysql

set global log_bin_trust_function_creators = 0;

quit;

8. Configure the database for Zabbix server

Edit file /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf and set the DB password with ->

sudo vim /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf

9. Start Zabbix server and agent processes

systemctl restart zabbix-server zabbix-agent apache2

systemctl enable zabbix-server zabbix-agent apache2

10. Open Zabbix UI web page and proceed with web ui config (should be self explanatory)

The default URL for Zabbix UI when using Apache web server is http://host/zabbix

1. Register bot: send "/newbot" to @BotFather and follow instructions
2. Copy and paste the obtained token into the "Token" field above
3. If you want to send personal notifications, you need to get chat id of the user you want to send messages to:
    3.1. Send "/getid" to "@myidbot" in Telegram messenger
    3.2. Copy returned chat id and save it in the "Telegram Webhook" media for the user
    3.3. Ask the user to send "/start" to your bot (Telegram bot won't send anything to the user without it)
4. If you want to send group notifications, you need to get group id of the group you want to send messages to:
    4.1. Add "@myidbot" to your group
    4.2. Send "/getgroupid@myidbot" in your group
    4.3. Copy returned group id save it in the "Telegram Webhook" media for the user you created for  group notifications
    4.4. Send "/start@your_bot_name_here" in your group (Telegram bot won't send anything to the group without it)
